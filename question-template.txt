I need help creating a book, one for each  of my two children, boy 9 years old and girl 7 years old. I will give you some material that I have read and done with them the past two days. But I need these books to re-enforce the study material. I would prefer if it is in the form of a story that they could read for themselves. But not tooo long that they will loose interest.
